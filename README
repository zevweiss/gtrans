gtrans - a pipe-oriented command-line client for Google's Translate API.

I imagine this has probably been done a million times; I just used it as a way
to play around with these newfangled interweb APIs everyone seems to be talking
about these days.

Great for translate-and-translate-back fun:
  $ ./gtrans -t de I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here | ./gtrans 
  [detected source language: en]
  [detected source language: de]
  I'm shocked, shocked that gambling is going to find in the database
